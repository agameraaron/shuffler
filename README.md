# Description
Much like how one could determine an answer by shuffling cards, throwing dice, shaking a magic 8-ball or spinning a prize wheel, this will give you a seemingly random response out of the answers you list. I created this with the intent to broadcast it via streaming and to leave each day's chosen task at the whimsey of dynamic computer numbers. 

# Features
- Let a twitch action algorithm make all your important decisions
- Algorithm is absent of randomness (how long you hold the shuffle button determines the shuffle strength)

# To Do
- Fix mouse-over descriptions.
- Don't allow empty entries.
- Probably a lot of other things I'm forgetting.
