### About:
MIT licensed, created by AGamerAaron.

Created & editable in Godot Engine v3.0: https://godotengine.org/

### Description:
Much like how one could determine an answer by shuffling cards, throwing dice, shaking a magic 8-ball or spinning a prize wheel, this will give you a seemingly random response out of the answers you list. I created this with the intent to whimsically choose whatever I wish over a stream.

### Features:
- Preferable to a coin toss.
- Custom lists.
- Holding the power button determines the shuffling time.
- Saving & loading of lists.
- Sorting and renaming options available.
- Background color can be changed. Useful for chroma keying.

### To Do:

##### High priority:
- Instead of reversing direction, the cycle should start again from the beginning of the list.

##### Low priority:
- Save and load prompts should be unmovable
- Remove multiple entries from the list at once.

##### Wish list:
- Allow textures to represent each entry

### History:
I wanted something to make decisions for me during streaming sessions. This is what I came up with. It works something like a digital roulette wheel including initial spin power and deceleration over time. Maybe a graphic representation of a wheel can be implemented in the future.
