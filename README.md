### About:
MIT licensed, created by AGamerAaron.

### Description:
Much like how one could determine an answer by shuffling cards, throwing dice, shaking a magic 8-ball or spinning a prize wheel, this will give you a seemingly random response out of the answers you list. I created this with the intent to broadcast it via streaming and to leave each day's chosen task at the whimsey of dynamic computer numbers. 

### Features:
- Preferable to a coin toss.
- Holding the power button determines the shuffling time.

### To Do:

##### High priority:
- Improve the wheel action to be more exciting.
- Don't allow empty entries.
- Anytime it's open the name entry screen receives focus and highlights the first entry in the list.
- Delete key removes the highlighted entry.
- If the name list is open, the 'enter' key will bring up the new name entry screen.

##### Low priority:
- Fix mouse-over descriptions.
- Fullscreen name entry screen.

### History:
I wanted something to make decisions for me during streaming sessions. This is what I came up with. It works something like a digital roulette wheel including initial spin power and deceleration over time. Maybe a graphic representation of a wheel can be implemented in the future.
