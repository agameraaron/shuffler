# Shuffler
A tool for shuffling around custom answers.

Much like how one could determine an answer by shuffling cards, throwing dice, shaking a magic 8-ball or spinning a prize wheel, this will give you a seemingly random response out of the answers you list. I created this with the intent to broadcast it via streaming and to leave each day's chosen task at the whimsey of dynamic computer numbers. 

Features:
- Does not use a random algorithm
- How long you hold the shuffle button determines the shuffle strength

To Do:
- When "velocity" reaches 0, the result becomes unmatched to the list. Figure out what number it's becoming & how to fix.
- When the power meter is hit at full, the acceleration doesn't decay toward zero like it should and therefore moves forever.
- Fix mouse-over descriptions.
- Don't allow empty entries.
- Probably a lot of other things I'm forgetting.
